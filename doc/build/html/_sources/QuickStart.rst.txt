QuickStart
========================



Introduction to DeepChrInteract
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Though deep learning methods have been widely developed for predicting chromatin interactions using flanking DNA sequence in identified chromatin interaction regions, 
a comprehensive software toolkit to integrate and evaluate different deep learning architectures are under-developed. 
By adopting different feature representation for flanking DNA sequence as well as different neural network architectures, 
we present DeepChrInteract (Deep learning for predicting Chromatin Interactions), which is a Python toolkit that offers representative deep learning methods to predict genome-wide chromatin interactions.
